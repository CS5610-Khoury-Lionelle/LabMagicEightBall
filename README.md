## Discussion Items
Use this section to write answers to the various discussion questions or add additional questions you may have. Treat this section along with your code as a study guide for yourself in the future, so put in here what helps you.


1. Define the differences between HTML, Javascript, and CSS



2. What are elements in the `head`? What ones do you know? Which ones do you not know (search online what they mean)? 


3. What is the 'type' used for with button. Why would we have it button and not 'submit' in this case?


4. Using the inspect side bar, highlight various elements. What is it doing? What happens if you change an element in the side bar, then refresh?

5. What is an event listener? Why would that be essential for webpages?

6. List at least three elements (CSS or HTML) that we did not cover in this tutorial.
